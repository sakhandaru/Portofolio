      <TextReveal title="About me ðŸ‘‹">Hi, Iâ€™m Sakhandaru â€” a passionate Frontend Developer currently exploring the world of backend development to become a well-rounded Fullstack Engineer. I love crafting clean, interactive, and efficient user interfaces with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and modern animation tools like GSAP and Framer Motion.
        With a focus on performance and user experience, I enjoy turning ideas into functional, visually engaging web applications. Currently, Iâ€™m building projects that combine aesthetic design with smooth animations, while learning cloud technologies to prepare for the next decade of tech.
        When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring new design trends, learning cutting-edge tools, or experimenting with UI/UX concepts.
